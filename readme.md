## Beginner Guide

**__New to Japanese?__** Start here!

1. All beginners should start with one of the guides below (the top two are the best in my personal opinion).  

	* [Starter's Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/wiki/index/startersguide) - From /r/learnjapanese subreddit.
	* [DJT guide](https://djtguide.neocities.org/guide.html) - A well-written guide.
	* [All Japanese All The Time (Overview/Timeline)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PdPOxiWWuU) - For people willing to completely immerse themselves in Japanese.
	* [Japanese Walkthrough](http://japaneselevelup.com/japanese-quest-walkthrough/) - A visual learning guide.
	* [Grammar Guide to Japanese](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar) - By Tae Kim (there also exists the "Complete Guide to Japanese" by Tae Kim, this is a work in progress/not yet complete).

2. A summary of the guides is basically this:  first, learn hiragana and katakana using the links in [Hiragana/Katkana](#hiragana-and-katakana) section further down this page.  The Tofugu links is a good starting place.

3. Next is grammar/vocabulary.  You can either use a structured textbook or a more free-form online grammar guide like Tae Kim.  Either one works, try one or both and stick with the one you like the best.  

	For vocabulary, three nice options are [Wanikani](https://www.wanikani.com/), [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/), and [Anki](https://djtguide.neocities.org/anki.html).  If you go with the Anki route, consider [using this deck](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zyyuiWkiz2IF2CCROeJebl8mgRdHBqNfS5D7MFjDTzE/edit), which is the same as the deck in the above link, but with the front and back flipped around to display sentences on the front rather than single words, as this will force you to learn words in context.

	For translation, try to avoid Google Translate.  Instead pick another one from the [Dictionary](#dictionary) list.

4. That's it.  There are many, many paths to learning Japanese.  The most important thing is to choose the one you enjoy.  If you don't enjoy your study, you won't succeed, so keep searching until you find the resource or study method that you enjoy.  Look through all the resources below, ask someone if you need help, and good luck.

## Textbook
